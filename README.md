ForeFlight iOS Coding Exercise

Completion time around 15h.

Project completed using the SwiftUI MVVM design pattern. Persistance achieved with CoreData. API "Layer" implemented with async/await. For the most part an attempt was made to seperate logic, but in the case of API it seemed like overkill to implement a sturdy and well structured layer, so this logic exists within the view-model. Navigation utilises the new NavigationStack with path method. All encountered and typical issues are resolved, in someplaces with "dirty" solutions, these have been noted with comments. 

No external or third party libraries were used.

No explicit references were consulted.
